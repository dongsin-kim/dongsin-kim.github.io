                    <p class="lead mb-5">482.SEEKING ONE'S COMPANY.—Are we then looking for too much when we seek the company of men who have grown mild, agreeable to the taste, and nutritive, like chestnuts which have been put into the fire and taken out just at the right moment? Of men who expect little from life, and prefer to accept this little as a present rather than as a merit of their own, as if it were carried to them by birds and bees? Of men who are too proud ever to feel themselves rewarded, and too serious in their passion for knowlegde and honesty to have time for or pleasure in fame? Such men we should call philosophers; but they themselves will always find some more modest designation. 20-DEC-2020</p>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">522.WISDOM WITHOUT EARS.—To hear every day what is said about us, or even to endeavour to discover what people think of us, will in the end kill even the strongest man. Our neighbours permit us to live only that they may exericise a daily claim upon us! They certainly would not tolerate us if we wished to claim rights over them, and still less if we wished to be right! In short, let us offer up a sacrifice to the general peace, let us not listen when they speak of us, when they praise us, blame us, wish for us, or hope for us—nay, let us not even think of it. 22-DEC-2020</p>

                    <h3 class="mb-0">The Meditations - Marcus Aurelius</h3>
                    <p class="lead mb-5">Book Seven.—What is badness? It is which thou hast often seen. And on the occation of everthing which happens keep this in mind, that it is that which thou hast often seen. Everywhere up and down thou wilt find the same things, with which the old histories are filled, those of the middle ages and those of our own day; with which cities and houese are filled now. There is nothing new: all things are both familiar and short-lived. 21-DEC-2020</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Book Seven.—How can our principles become dead, unless the impressions (thoughts) which correspond to them are extinguished? But it is in thy power continuously to fan these thoughts into a flame. I can have that opinion about anything, which I ought to have. If I can, why am I distrubed? The things which are external to my mind have no relation at all to my mind.- Let this be the state of thy affects, and thou standest erect. To recover thy life is in thy power. Look at things again as thou didst user to look at them; for in this consists the recovery of thy life. 21-DEC-2020</p>

                    <p class="lead mb-5">Book Seven.—Consider the past; such great changes of political supremacies. Thou mayest forsee also the things which will be. For they will certainly be of like form, and it is not possible that they should deviate from the order of the tings which take place now: accordingly to have contemplated human life for forty years is the same as to have contemplated it for ten thousand years. For what more wilt thou see? 23-DEC-2020</p>
